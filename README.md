Game Engine
==========

Simple 2d game engine I'm using to develop Ludum Dare games

Requires following components to run:
SDL2: http://www.libsdl.org/
SDL2_mixer: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
SDL2_image: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

Download them, create folder "SDL2" in /engine directory, and put the content of downloaded archives into it.
The final structure should contain /engine/SDL2/include and /engine/SDL2/lib
